    "# Meta-Prompting Scaffolding Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a hands-on tutorial on the concept of meta-prompting scaffolding, a method designed to enhance the efficiency of Language Models by using task-agnostic scaffolding strategies. The goal here is to demonstrate how we can enhance a standard language model by integrating specialized expert systems, resulting in an overall richer and more capable AI solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-prompting is a sophisticated mechanism that enhances the language model's capability to handle complex tasks by breaking them down and distributing them among multiple expert models. Each expert tackles a portion of the task, and their insights are aggregated to provide a final, integrated solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to implement a simplified version of meta-prompting scaffolding using OpenAI's Chat Completion API as our language model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
