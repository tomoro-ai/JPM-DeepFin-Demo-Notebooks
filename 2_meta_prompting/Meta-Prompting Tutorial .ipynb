    "# Meta-Prompting Scaffolding Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on tutorial on the concept of meta-prompting scaffolding, a method designed to enhance the efficiency of Language Models by using task-agnostic scaffolding strategies. The goal here is to demonstrate how we can enhance a standard language model by integrating specialized expert systems, resulting in an overall richer and more capable AI solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-prompting is a sophisticated mechanism that enhances the language model's capability to handle complex tasks by breaking them down and distributing them among multiple expert models. Each expert tackles a portion of the task, and their insights are aggregated to provide a final, integrated solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to implement a simplified version of meta-prompting scaffolding using OpenAI's Chat Completion API as our language model. \n",

      "However, the task and the data aren't exactly formulated as a clear instruction, and the requested information that's 'target' can be a source of misunderstanding. It would be clearer to put the instruction in a conversational manner to stimulate interactivity, and, instead of 'target', use a recognizable term like 'desired output' or 'expected move'. The task also lacks context - a short introduction about the situation could help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Restructuring the prompt\n",
      "The improved prompt will start with an introductory sentence which outlines the scenario. The task will be clearly defined within a question. There will be a section to include 'Input Chess Moves', where the series of chess moves are presented. Lastly, there will be a section titled 'Expected Checkmate Move', which will provide a space for the expected chess move that should result in a checkmate.\n",
